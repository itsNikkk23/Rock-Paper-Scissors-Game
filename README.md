# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

:) Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

-> Rock: A closed fist.
-> Paper: A flat hand.
-> Scissors: A fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V.

:) The game has three possible outcomes:

-> Draw: If both players choose the same shape.
-> Win: Rock beats scissors, paper covers rock.
-> Loss: Paper loses to scissors.
